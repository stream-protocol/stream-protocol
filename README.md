### Blockchain Technology

Stream Protocol has built its infrastructure on Solana, a high-performance blockchain platform known for its scalability, speed, and low cost. Solana's technology allows Stream Protocol to handle high transaction volume and low latency, making it a suitable choice for decentralized applications that require high throughput. The platform has attracted a growing number of supporters, developers, projects, and partnerships which are built on it, making the platform more promising. Solana's high-performance capabilities make it a suitable choice for decentralized applications like StreamPay which requires fast and efficient transactions. Overall, Solana's technology is one of the most promising blockchain platforms in the industry, and Stream Protocol's choice to use Solana for its infrastructure, shows the potential for the platform to provide a seamless and efficient payment solution.

### Why Solana?

Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform that aims to provide fast, low-cost transactions for decentralized applications. It uses a novel consensus mechanism called "Proof of Stake Time" (PoST) and a technology called "Tower BFT" to achieve its high throughput. Some of the key features of Solana include:

- High throughput: Solana can process up to 65,000 transactions per second, making it one of the most scalable blockchain platforms.
Low latency: Transactions on Solana are confirmed in under 400 milliseconds, providing fast confirmation times for users.
Low cost: Solana uses a unique consensus mechanism called "Proof of Stake Time" (PoST) which reduces the cost of running a node and facilitates a more decentralized network.

- Energy efficient: Solana's consensus mechanism is designed to be energy-efficient, reducing the environmental impact of the network.
Decentralized: Solana uses a decentralized network of validators to process transactions and secure the network, making it resistant to censorship and control.

Solana is compatible with other blockchain protocols, enabling interoperability between different networks.
Solana has a growing number of projects and partnerships, which are built on it, making it a promising choice for decentralized applications like StreamPay.

## Mission
